  // Poems about Maggie
  poems: [
    `Little Maggie, soft and sweet,
    With tiny paws and dancing feet.
    Telling stories, day and night,
    Bringing children pure delight.

    From Creation to Noah's boat,
    Bible tales on which to dote.
    Maggie's voice, so kind and true,
    Sharing God's love, just for you.`,
    
    `Maggie, Maggie, small and bright,
    Yorkie Poo with eyes so bright.
    Narrating tales of long ago,
    Teaching lessons as we grow.

    God made earth in seven days,
    Maggie tells in special ways.
    Listen close to what she'll say,
    Let her guide you on your way.`,
    
    `A little dog with a big, big heart,
    Maggie's stories are a work of art.
    She speaks of whales and arks and doves,
    And most of all, of God's great love.

    Her books are treasures on your shelf,
    Each one better than the last itself.
    So cuddle up and turn the page,
    Maggie's wisdom knows no age.`

  // Short stories about Maggie
  stories: [
    `Once upon a time, there was a small Yorkie Poo named Maggie who loved to listen to bedtime stories. Every night, her owner would read to her from a big book of Bible stories, and Maggie would listen with her ears perked up and her eyes wide with wonder.

One evening, as her owner closed the book after reading about Creation, Maggie had a dream. In her dream, she could talk! She imagined telling all the wonderful Bible stories to children around the world.

When Maggie woke up, she was so excited about her dream that she ran around the house with joy. Her owner noticed this enthusiasm and had an idea - what if Maggie could "narrate" children's books? And that's how Maggie's storytelling adventure began. Now children everywhere can read Bible stories as told by a little dog with a big heart for sharing God's word.`,
    
    `Maggie was visiting a children's hospital one sunny afternoon. Her owner had brought her to cheer up the children, along with copies of Maggie's books to read to them.

As they entered a room where a little girl named Emma was staying, they noticed Emma looked sad. She hadn't smiled in days, the nurses said. Maggie gently approached Emma's bed and placed her paw on the blanket.

Emma's eyes widened at the sight of the small, fluffy dog. "Is this Maggie? From the books?" she asked in a small voice.

"Yes, it is!" her owner replied. "Would you like to hear a story?"

As Maggie's owner read "Noah's Ark as told by Maggie," the little dog sat attentively by Emma's side. By the end of the story, Emma was giggling and petting Maggie's soft fur.

"Maggie made me happy again," Emma told the nurse later. And from that day on, Maggie's visits became a regular event at the children's hospital, bringing joy and Bible stories to many young hearts.`,
    
    `Maggie was having a very important day - it was her first book signing! Children and parents lined up around the block to meet the famous storytelling dog and get their copies of "Creation as told by Maggie" signed with a special paw print.

Maggie sat proudly on a small table, wearing a tiny purple bow tie for the occasion. Her owner helped her press her paw onto an ink pad and then onto each book.

One little boy approached shyly. "Maggie," he whispered, "your stories helped me understand God better." Maggie wagged her tail happily, as if to say she understood.

By the end of the day, Maggie was tired but content. She had shared her love of Bible stories with so many children, and nothing made her happier than seeing their smiling faces as they clutched their signed books. As she dozed off that night, she dreamed of all the new stories she would tell in the future.`
